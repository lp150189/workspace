variable needs to start with _ $ a A after that you can use any symbol but you can also use number
4 basic data types
	1) String
	2) number
	3) boolean
	4) object
There are array in javascript but array is considered objects
MAX_NUMBER AND MIN_NUMBER ARE: 1.7976931348623157e+308  and  5e-324
Here are some escape character \" \' \\ \t \n these are special character that you have to have the backlash 


Boolean value 
False can have "false" or "NaN"

how to declare array in javascript

which is  var vehicles = new Array("car","truck", "van");

if else statement is just like java

ar rand_var = (5<10) ? "5 is less than 10" : "5 is greater than 10";
This statement means if 5<10 = true then assign it to the first string. Other wise assign the second string to rand_var


external function with javascript 
<script> language = "javascript" src = "addfunction2.js"></script>

Object oriented Programming
Technically, javascript doesnt have any kind of class structure
To create a method in the class you do Class.prototype.nameOfmethod = function(data){
	
}
To inherit from a class yo do

		function Cat()
		{
			Animal.call(this);
			this.mode = "Happy";
		}

		Cat.prototype = new Animal();
		Cat.prototype.constructor = Cat;


To check the type of an instance we do
document.write(sophie instanceof Cat);
document.write(typeof)

method overloading: many methods would have the same name but the number of variables in declaration would be different

Polymorphism: Since javasciprt doesnt specify the things that you can pass in a function, you can pass anything in there. 

function of Array
	join("string")
	slice()
	reverse()
	splice()
